I also take a keen interest in public engagement and improving access for minorities in STEM. In 2022 I was awarded the Postgraduate Warwick Award for Public and Community Engagement ([WAPCE](https://warwick.ac.uk/wie/recognition/wapce/)) partly due to my work with STEM Connections, in which I created a activity aimed at the intersection of art and science. The activity [Embroider a Sunquake!](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/about/outreach/stemconnections/resources/helioseismology/) has been showcased to over 500 students and has been exhibited at the National Astronomy Meeting 2022 and the Caithness International Science Festival 2022.

I have also spoken at a number of 'Pint of Science' public lectures: "What to do when the Sun throws a temper tantrum" (2018) , "Who would win in a fight; the Sun or a billion lions?" (co-written and co-presented with Dr. Alun Rees, 2019), and "[Escaping the Sun: a photon's 100,000 year journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjHttkL6ie0&t=264s)" (2021)

I've also regularly spoken at Warwick's Christmas Lectures to audiences of 1000+. In 2018 this was alongside Dr. Anne-Marie Broomhall on "Do you hear that Star Singing? Unveiling the music of helioseismology". In 2020, the Christmas Lectures moved online, and I presented "[How to measure distances in space: The astronomical ruler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKr9WOxtyqQ&t=33s)" (2020). Since 2021, I have been invited back annually as a guest co-presenter at the Christmas Lectures, which led to our being awarded with the [Warwick Wows and Wonders Award](https://warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/intnews2/january_wonders_and_wows/).

I'm available to write and perform bespoke lectures/ live science shows, ideal for audiences aged 7 and up. To enquire about my speakers fee, or if you are planning an outreach event, and want to discuss improving inclusion etc. please get in touch at [tishtrya.mehta@gmail.com](tishtrya.mehta@gmail.com)! 

I am a former STEM Ambassador, with a full and up-to-date DBS check, with certification in Child Protection Fundamentals.

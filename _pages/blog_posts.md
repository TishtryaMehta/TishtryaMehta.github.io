I also take a keen interest in public engagement and improving access for minorities in STEM. In 2022 I was awarded the Postgraduate Warwick Award for Public and Community Engagement (WAPCE) partly due to my work with STEM Connections, in which I created a activity aimed at the intersection of art and science. The activity 'Embroider a Sunquake!' has been showcased to over 500 students and has been exhibited at the National Astronomy Meeting 2022 and the Caithness International Science Festival 2022.

I have also spoken at a number of 'Pint of Science' public lectures: "What to do when the Sun throws a temper tantrum" (2018) , "Who would win in a fight; the Sun or a billion lions?" (co-written and co-presented with Dr. Alun Rees, 2019), and "Escaping the Sun: a photon's 100,000 year journey" (Watchable on Youtube, 2021)

I've also regularly spoken at Warwick's Christmas Lectures to audiences of 1000+. In 2018 this was alongside Dr. Anne-Marie Broomhall on "Do you hear that Star Singing? Unveiling the music of helioseismology". In 2020, the Christmas Lectures moved online, and I presented "How to measure distances in space: The astronomical ruler" (Watchable on Youtube, 2020). Since 2021, I have been invited back annually as a guest co-presenter at the Christmas Lectures.

If you are planning an outreach event, or want to discuss improving inclusion etc. please get in touch! STEM Ambassador (DBS checked), with certification in Child Protection Fundamentals.

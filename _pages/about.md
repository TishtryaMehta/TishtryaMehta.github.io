*Hi there!*

I'm a former astrophysicist, data scientist, a passionate advocate for widening participation in STEM, and [award winning](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/news/?newsItem=8a17841b8659de1e0186a2cd70aa1649) science communicator based in London. 

I have a fascination for finding beauty in chaos, which fuelled my scientific interest in looking at the light emitted by our Sun and other stars. I have a PhD in Helioseismology (which is the science of Earthquakes on the Sun!), and spent the better part of a decade looking at solar flares thorough a telescope. As a Research Fellow, I spent my time building pipelines to assess astrophysical data for repeating patterns. These days, I can be found looking at data closer to home to identify trends that may impact our day-to-day lives.

Outside of the lab, I'm an expert in outreach and public engagement, with specialities in on-stage lectures and hands-on live science shows. I have been invited across the UK to educate and inspire, giving bespoke lectures on topics ranging from "The Death of the Universe" to "The Music of the Stars"! If you would like to organise an interactive lecture for your school, please get in touch at tishtrya.mehta@gmail.com.

I'm also an avid crafter, and love anything that combines my love of maths, patterns, and creativity (for what is knitting, but coding with yarn!). I've made several quilts, dresses, and unstable clay pots, and am always on the look out for new artforms. 

By the way, it's pronounced *Tish*-tree-uh *Meh*-ta (Not Trish, Trash, Titch, Patricia, or Fish*)

*All of which are real things I've been called!

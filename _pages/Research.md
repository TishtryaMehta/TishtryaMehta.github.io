My research covers oscillatory signals of solar and stellar origin. My PhD and Research Fellowship mainly focussed on Helioseismology, while my Masters Research largely looked at Quasi-Periodic Pulsations.

Below are a select few publications I wrote or contributed to, alongside my PhD and Masters theses.
